Description: Conducts a cointegration test for high-dimensional vector autoregressions (VARs) of order k based on the large N,T asymptotics of Bykhovskaya and Gorin, 2022 (<doi:10.48550/arXiv.2202.07150>). The implemented test is a modification of the Johansen likelihood ratio test. In the absence of cointegration the test converges to the partial sum of the Airy-1 point process. This package contains simulated quantiles of the first ten partial sums of the Airy-1 point process that are precise up to the first three digits.
